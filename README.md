lang
====

Script to quickly check what the development environment on a machine. Built on Mac OS X systems, I expect that it would need some modifications to run on other Unix-like systems. This branch will remain OS X-specific for the foreseeable future, and hence will make reference to things like swift, brew and Xcode that would be absent elsewhere. Please contribute if you have more languages and related tools that should be included!

Installation:
Place the file "lang" anywhere in your system's PATH (like in /usr/local/bin/) and make it executable (chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lang). Then simply run the command by typing "lang".
